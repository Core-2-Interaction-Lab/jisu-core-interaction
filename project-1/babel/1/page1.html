                    The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal<br>
                    galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, <br>
                    interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves<br>
                    per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that<Br>
                    of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the<Br>
                    first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may <Br>
                    sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks <br>
                    abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all <br>
                    appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory<br>
                    duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some <Br>
                    spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is <br>
                    insufficient, incessant.Â
