                    진열실은 도서관 전체에 걸쳐 동일하게 배치된 육각형 모양의 방이다. 각 육각형 진열실에는 스무 개의 책장이 있으며, 보통 키의 사서보다 약간 높은 책장들이 육각형의 네 면을 각각 다섯 개씩 덮고 있다. 진열실의 중앙에는 낮은 난간으로 둘러싸인 거대한 통풍구가 있는데, 이 덕분에 그 어떤 진열실에서도 상하의 층이 무한히 보인다고 한다. 진열실은 '등'이라는 이름의 둥근 열매들로 밝히는데, '등'의 밝기는 약하지만 정전되는 법은 없다.
                    복도는 책장으로 덮여 있지 않은 두 면 중의 하나와 연결되어 있고 다른 진열실과 이어진다. 복도 좌우로는 작은 문간방이 두 개 있는데, 하나는 선 채로 자는 방이고 다른 하나는 생리적인 문제를 해결하는 방이다.

        Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.

            There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.
